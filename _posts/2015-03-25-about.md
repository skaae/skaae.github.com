title: About
---
I am a Ph.D. student (2014-) at the University of Copenhagen at the Bioinformatics Centre. My supervisors are [Ole Winther](http://cogsys.imm.dtu.dk/staff/winther/) and [Anders Krogh](http://www.binf.ku.dk/staff/?pure=en/persons/8330). I hold a M.Sc. in Systems Biology (Bioinformatics) from the Technical University of Denmark and a B.Sc in Biomedical engineering from University of Aalborg.  

My research interests are the application of deep learning to biological sequence data. So far my research have focused on applying recurrent networks to analysis of biological sequences. I have worked on combining LSTM networks and convolutions and have also worked on visualizing convolutional filters learned from DNA or amino acid sequences. 
In [Convolutional LSTM Networks for Subcellular Localization of Proteins](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7828) we showed that convolutional filters visualized as [sequence logos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_logo) can be interpreted as [sequence motif](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_motif) detectors.

I am currently working on attention mechanisms and variational auto encoders applied to biological sequences. I regularly publish code at [github](https://github.com/skaae/) and have programming experience in both LUA/Troch, Python/Theano and a number of other languages.
