title: Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines
---
This post tries to reproduce a figure 4 in the paper ["Training Restricted Boltzmann Machines using Approximations to the Likelihood Gradient"](http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~tijmen/pcd/pcd.pdf). 

The figure shows samples drawn from two different RBM's trained on the MNIST data set. The first RBM is trained with persistent contrastive divergence (PCD) and the second RBM is trained with contrastive divergence (CD).
